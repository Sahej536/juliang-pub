## Week 4 Learn Together

## Day 5 Final
For this weeks learn together I decided to refactor the password generator
that we made for the final for day 5. The program asks the user if they want
to create a password and how many letters, symbols and numbers they would like in
their password. The program then creates and displays the password on the screen.
